### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5 was one of my favorite labs because I had a really good partner this time who really helped me understand the correct format and the many errors I had in my code. This was probably my first lab in which I truly understood what was happening and for that I will remember it. I still think after this whole semester dffi.cc and dffi_functions.cc were the hardest .cc files.

* Lab 8

    Lab 8 was most likely my favorite because this lab I did not have a partner and was left to do it myself. You can see the happiness in my face when I realized my build had passed. I would have been happier if I fixed my format though, I still had some ways to go from lab 5. Also sandwich.cc with the protein part was the most memorable .cc file for me. 

* Lab 10

    Lab 10 I really liked because I had a good partner who I felt had the same skill level as me so it was really nice collaborating with each other and getting that perfect 30/30 together.
